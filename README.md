### Project Description:

I'm going to build a simple event-driven application using AWS services like Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service).

Use Case: Image Upload Notification System
When an image is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function will process the event and send a notification through SNS.

### Project Architecture:

### Steps to Build the Project:

* Step 1: Set Up an AWS Account 
* Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket
* Step 3: Create an SNS Topic
* Step 4: Create a Subscription 
* Step 5: Create a Lambda Function
* Step 6: Add S3 trigger 
* Step 7: Write Lambda Function Code 
* Step 8: Test the System

### Expected Outcome:

By following these steps, I will have created a simple event-driven application on AWS that demonstrates the core principles of EDA. This setup can be expanded to more complex scenarios as I become more comfortable with the architecture and AWS services.
